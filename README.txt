If i had more time I could have properly implemented all of the functionality and made it pretty. However, Seeing as this is already several weeks late I going to go with this and then start part 3. Hoping to finish part three by tomorrow night (November 7) so that I can give my full time commitment to my group. 

This is lacking the search for subject, search by both, and homepage enrolled classes sections. However, the login, course search, and displays work.
